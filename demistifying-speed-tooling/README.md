## Fundamentals

### 1. Benchmark with PageSpeed Insights

* still the best starting point for everyone

### 2. Iterate with Lighthouse via the Devtools/Audits panel

* now with stack packs - tailored advice to your stack (e.g. Wordpress)

### 3. Track your field data with the CrUX Dashboard

* Google Data Studio report built on CrUX data

### 4. Understand key speed metrics

FCP, FID, TTI + new metrics in development:

* layout stability: https://gist.github.com/skobes/2f296da1b0a88cc785a4bf10a42bca07 (origin trial, too)
* largest contentful paint

### Taxonomy of speed tooling

### Curate organizational buy-in

Make the business realize the conversion impact and how performance is a feature.

## Professional techniques

### 5. Explore field data from within the Search Console 

### 6. Define a performance budget

Now within Lighthouse:

* Docs - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/budgets
* Budget calculator - https://perf-budget-calculator.firebaseapp.com/

### 7. Profile with Devtools/Performance panel

* Devtools > Performance Docs - https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/

### 8. Implement production monitoring

Lab/synthetic checks on production

* Calibre, Treo, Speedcurve
* web.dev/measure
* PSI API - https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started

### 9. Adopt a RUM solution

Collect field data from your users

* Firebase has this built-in

### 10. Conduct competitive analytics with CrUX

* build yourself using CrUX Cookbook: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/CrUX

My 2c: you can also try Akamai's comparison tool built on CrUX data: https://developer.akamai.com/akamai-mpulse/crux-benchmarking

## Robust regression defense

### 11. Connect RUM metrics with business goals

* choose representative pages and correlate over time

### 12. Audit and improve use of 3rd party tags

* requestmap.webperf.tools
* patrickhulce/thirdparty-web

My 2c: tracking network requests + size is cool but should also look at CPU time spent on Main Thread (see https://speedcurve.com/blog/third-party-blame-game/)

### 13. Devise custom performance metrics

* KPIs specific to your site
* e.g. Element timing - https://developers.chrome.com/origintrials/#/view_trial/3954160472831295489 (origin trial)

### 14. Create a Lighthouse plugin

* Handbook: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/plugins.md

My 2c: finally easily shareable as npm module (unlike the old custom audits)

### 15. Implement performane measurement in CI

* especially if for all PRs
* LightHouse CI coming soon...

My 2c: Do they mean https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/lighthousebot?
